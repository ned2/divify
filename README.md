divify
======

A JavaScript tool for pixelating an image into a grid of divs. It
works by converting the image into a div of floated divs, each with
their background color set to the average color from that area of the
original image and the parent div's width set to the width of the
original image.

To use, you only need to include divify.js in your page. For usage
instructions see divify.js, and for a more elaborated overview, see
demo.html.
